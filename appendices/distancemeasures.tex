For the sake of simplicity, only the distance between discrete 3D-surfaces represented by triangular meshes will be defined. A discrete 3D-surface is usually represented by a set of points $S = \lbrace p_1, p_2, ..,p_n \rbrace$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (vertices),  and by a set $\mathcal{T}$ of triangles describing how the vertices from S are linked together. Thus, the similarity between two surfaces is measured by computing distances between the respective point sets.  
Let define a point $p$ belonging to the surface $S$, and a point $q$ belonging to the surface $S'$.

\subsubsection*{Euclidean distance between two points}
The Euclidian distance is defined as the shortest possible path through space between two points (also named the $L^2-norm$) and is defined as:
\begin{equation}
D(p,q) =\Vert p-q \Vert_2  =(\vert p_x -q_x\vert^2+\vert p_y-q_y\vert^2+\vert p_z-q_z\vert^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Node to surface distance}
 The distance $D'(p, S')$ from the point $p$ to the surface $S'$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
D'(p,S') = min_{q \in S'} \Vert p-q\Vert_2
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Minimal distance between two surfaces}
The minimal distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D'_{min}(S, S') =  min_{p \in S} \lbrace D'(p, S') \rbrace
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Maximal distance between two surfaces}
The maximal distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D'_{max}(S, S') =  max_{p \in S} \lbrace D'(p, S')\rbrace
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Mean distance between two surfaces}
The mean distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D'_{mean}(S, S') = \frac{1}{\vert S \vert} \sum_{p \in S}  D'(p, S') 
\end{equation}

where $\vert S \vert$ is the number of nodes belonging to the surface S.
\subsubsection*{Hausdorff distance between two surfaces}
The Hausdorff distance \citep{huttenlocher_comparing_1993} between two surfaces is defined as 
\begin{equation}
H(S,S') = max \lbrace D'_{max}(S,S'), D'_{max}(S',S)\rbrace
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Modified Hausdorff distance between two surfaces}
The modified Hausdorff distance between two surfaces is defined as 
\begin{equation}
H'(S,S') = max \lbrace D'_{mean}(S,S'), D'_{mean}(S',S)\rbrace
\end{equation}

Dubuisson and Jain \cite{dubuisson_modified_1994} have studied 24 measures to assess the similarities between two discrete surface meshes. According to the authors, the Hausdorff distance has the best performance for object matching.
