For the sake of simplicity, only the distance between discrete 3D-surfaces represented by triangular meshes will be defined. A discrete 3D-surface is usually represented by a set of point $S = \lbrace p^1, p^2, ..,p^n \rbrace$; thus, the similarity between two surfaces is measures by computing distance measures between the respective points sets.  

 First, the definition pf the point to point Euclidean distance is given, followed by different surface to surfaces distances derived form the Euclidean one.

\subsubsection*{Euclidean distance between two points}
The Euclidian distance is defined as the shortest possible path through space between two points, also called the $L^2-norm$.  Let consider two points $p$ and $p'$ defined in a 3-dimensional space, the distance magnitude is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D(p,p') =\Vert p-p' \Vert_2  =(\sum_{n=0}^{3} \vert p_i - p'_i \vert^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Node to surface distance}
The distance $D'(p, S')$ between the point $p$ and the surface $S'$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
D^s(p,S') = min_{q \in S'} \Vert p-p'\Vert_2
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Minimal distance between two surfaces}
The minimal distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D^S_{min}(S, S') =  min_{p \in S} \lbrace D^s(p, S') \rbrace
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Maximal distance between two surfaces}
The maximal distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D^S_{max}(S, S') =  max_{p \in S} \lbrace D^s(p, S')\rbrace
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Mean distance between two surfaces}
The mean distance between two surfaces $S$ and $S'$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
D^S_{mean}(S, S') = \frac{1}{\vert S \vert} \sum_{p \in S}  D^s(p, S') 
\end{equation}

where $\vert S \vert$ is the number of nodes bellowing the surface S.
\subsubsection*{Hausdorff distance between two surfaces}
The Hausdorff distance \citep{huttenlocher_comparing_1993} between two surfaces is defined as 
\begin{equation}
H(S,S') = max \lbrace D^S_{max}(S,S'), D^S_{max}(S',S)\rbrace
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Modified Hausdorff distance between two surfaces}
The modified Hausdorff distance between two surfaces is defined as 
\begin{equation}
H(S,S') = max \lbrace D^S_{mean}(S,S'), D^S_{mean}(S',S)\rbrace
\end{equation}

\cite{dubuisson_modified_1994} have studied 24 measures to asses the similarities between two discrete surface mesh. According to the authors, Hausdorff distance have the best performance for object matching.
